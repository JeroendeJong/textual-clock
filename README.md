# Textual Clock

Hi! this is a side project I got inspired to build after walking through the streets and seeing a similair clock. I thought it would be cool 
to building something like this specificlaly because it would be a cool piece to display in your shop instead a traditional clock. 

Due to the extreme differences in the way time is spoken in diferent languages, every language has its own distinct logic. In the future, as more languages gets added its worth re-assess what the commonalitites between languages are, and what we can deduce from this. 

For now this app supports three locales: English, Dutch and Russian. Feel free to add more if you like! just make sure all different cases for the language are covered by tests, since it is hard to ensure ALL times are good without writing some tests.
